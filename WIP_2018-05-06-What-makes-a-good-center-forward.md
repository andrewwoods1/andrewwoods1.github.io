title: What makes a goal scorer?
---

The summer transfer window is underway, with the usual glut of clubs looking to improve on the forward options already in their squad. 
This includes my own Leeds, who are involved in a quite public pursuit of Abel Hernandez. formerly of Hull City. Searching  through fan
forums, the inevitible comparisons to Chris Wood are there to be seen, as well as the usual discussion of whether the considerable outlay on Hernandez will be worth it.

Questions such as the rather vague '*is he any good?'*, to the somewhat more analytical '*how clinical is he?*' are posed, however how do we measure these qualities?

In essence, what makes a goal scorer *good*?

If we pose this question with the more traditional view of a center forward in mind (i.e. a player who's primary focus is simply to score) then the answer could be given as a combination of **chance getting**  and **chance taking** ability. Of course, this ignores the offensive contribution of the player outside of goal scoring, but for this analysis, we'll look solely at this quality.

**How can a player's 'chance getting' ability be measured?**
Let's first look at each player's *chance getting* ability, that is to say, their ability to get into goal scoring positions. To measure this we can simply look at each player's expected goals (xG) per game. **flesh this out**
