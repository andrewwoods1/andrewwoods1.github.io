title: What makes a good center forward?
---

The summer transfer window is underway, with the usual glut of clubs looking to improve on the goal scores already in their squad. 
This includes my own Leeds, who are involved in a quite public pursuit of Abel Hernandez. formerly of Hull City. Searching  through fan
forums, the inevitible comparisons to Chris Wood are there to be seen, as well as the usual discussion of whether the considerable outlay on Hernandez will be worth it.

Questions such as the rather vague '*is he any good?'*, to the somewhat more analytical '*how clinical is he?*' are posed, however how do we measure these qualities?

In essence, what makes a center forward *good*?

If we pose this question with the more traditional view of a center forward in mind (i.e. a player who's primary focus is simply to score) then the answer could be given as a combination of **chance getting**  and **chance taking** ability.
