title: Soccermatics odds-bias strategy - Does it apply to Irish league football?
---

In his book Soccermatics: Mathematical Adventures in the Beautiful Game, David Sumpter trials a number of gambling strategies on English Premier League football.

Of these, success was found using what was termed as the 'odds-bias' strategy. This involved placing bets as follows, using the Kelly Criterion.

In his book, Dr. Sumpter fits a logistic regression model to estimate the 'true' odds, based on the odds offered by bookmakers. Prior to this he identifies some biases in the probabilities implied by bookies' odds, and the frequency with which these events occur. In doing this, an opportunity to make value bets was identified.

The overall strategy was as follows:

For games where the win probablitlies based on bookmakers' odds was greater than 40% in favour of the home side, a bet was placed on a home win.

For games where this differential was less than 15%, a bet was placed on a draw.

First, let's try and identify biases in the odds of the past 1200 League of Ireland football matches, similar to those found in the book. The plots below show the odds probabilities and corresponding occurence rate for home wins and draws in the league, since 2012.
