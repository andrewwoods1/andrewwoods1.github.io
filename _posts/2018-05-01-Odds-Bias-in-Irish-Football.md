title: Soccermatics odds-bias strategy - Does it apply to Irish league football?
---

In his book Soccermatics: Mathematical Adventures in the Beautiful Game, David Sumpter trials a number of gambling strategies on English Premier League football.

Of these, success was found using what was termed as the 'odds-bias' strategy. This involved placing bets as follows, using the Kelly Criterion.

In his book, Dr. Sumpter fits a logistic regression model to estimate the 'true' odds, based on the odds offered by bookmakers. Prior to this he identifies some biases in the probabilities implied by bookies' odds, and the frequency with which these events occur. In doing this, an opportunity to make value bets was identified.

The overall strategy was as follows:

For games where the win probablitlies based on bookmakers' odds was greater than 40% in favour of the home side, a bet was placed on a home win.

For games where this differential was less than 15%, a bet was placed on a draw.

First, let's apply this strategy to League of Ireland football, across 1245 matches, from 2012 to 2018. In doing this we assume that any bias found in odds in 2012, is still present in 2018, i.e. that the market has not changed significantly, and that bookmaker's techniques remain the same. This asumption is openj to question, however is reasonable, given this is a minor league, not attracting much attention from bookmakers.

Below is a graph of the Soccermatics odds-bias strategy returns over time, with a starting bankroll of $1000, placing 5% of our bank on each bet.
