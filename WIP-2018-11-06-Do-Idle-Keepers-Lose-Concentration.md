title: Do idle keepers lose concentration?
---

A much used trope on the co-comms circuit is the congratulatory words for goalkeepers who make a save having stood idle for a certain period.
Watching England's pre-World Cup friendly with Costa Rica, Glen Hoddle could be heard trotting out this line after he faced, and saved, his first shot.

*Well done* was gist of the comment for what was a routine save not worthy of plaudits, particularly for an England goalkeeper. The implication here is that in making such a save, Butland has had to overcome an extra impediment to simply making the save, brought on my the amount of time the ball spent in the opposite end of the pitch.

However, the question should be asked; is there any basis to this, and if not, why is this clich√© an accepted form of *analysis* in mainstream coverage of football?
